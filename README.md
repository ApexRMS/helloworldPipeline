# **helloworldPipeline**

**helloworldPipeline** is an open-source [SyncroSim](http://www.syncrosim.com) base package, part of the [helloworldEnhanced](https://github.com/ApexRMS/helloworldEnhanced) package suite. It was designed as a basic example of how to use model pipelines in a custom SyncroSim package, such that the output from one model can be used as the input for the next model. 

For more information, see the [Enhancing a Package](http://docs.syncrosim.com/how_to_guides/package_create_pipelines.html) tutorial in the SyncroSim documentation or the [helloworldEnhanced](https://apexrms.github.io/helloworldEnhanced/) website.
